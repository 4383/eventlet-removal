    <h2 class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold">50 Shades of Danger</h2>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">It do not matter if you are a a developer, project owner, a planning maker, or a business owner, everyone will find what they are looking for in the arguments set out below.</p>

    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Legal Danger</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Using obsolete and poorly maintained technologies, such as Eventlet, exposes companies to increased security vulnerabilities, thereby compromising the protection of personal data of their product users and their compliance with the GDPR and with data protection authority rules. In many cases, companies have been ordered to pay millions of dollars by courts around the world (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equifax#March_2017_security_breach" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">USA</a>, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affaire_de_la_fuite_de_donn%C3%A9es_de_sant%C3%A9_de_laboratoires_fran%C3%A7ais" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">Europe</a>) due to a security breach in their systems. Data protection authorities, like the CNIL in France, often have the power to impose financial penalties reaching several million euros or, in the case of a company, up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover.​</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Obsolete technologies are more likely to contain unpatched vulnerabilities, increasing the risk of unauthorized access to personal data. The GDPR and data protection authorities require companies to implement appropriate measures to ensure the security of personal data, and failure to comply with these obligations can lead to severe sanctions.​</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">However, by adopting modern and well-maintained technologies, training staff in cybersecurity, and conducting data protection impact assessments, companies can significantly reduce these risks. It is therefore strongly recommended that companies avoid using obsolete technologies like Eventlet and adopt modern, well-maintained solutions to ensure the security of personal data.​</p>

    <p class="mt-10 text-xl text-yellow-300"><strong>Failing to remove Eventlet from your products exposes your business to legal penalties, for which you could be held personally liable in court.<br>Neglecting necessary updates nurtures needless risks</strong>.</p>
