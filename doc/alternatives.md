title: Understand the Alternatives to Eventlet
---
<section>
    <h1 class="text-4xl font-bold">Understanding Alternatives</h1>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Eventlet is designed to facilitate asynchronous programming using green threads and monkey patching. Alternatives such as <a href="https://docs.python.org/fr/3.13/library/asyncio.html"  class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">AsyncIO</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/fr/3.13/library/threading.html"  class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">native threads</a> offer different approaches to concurrency and asynchrony, making them viable replacements for Eventlet.​</p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold">Advantages of AsyncIO</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Explicit Asynchronous Programming</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">AsyncIO employs an explicit approach to asynchronous programming, utilizing <code class="text-xl language-python">async</code> and <code class="text-xl language-python">await</code> keywords. This explicitness enhances code readability and maintainability, allowing developers to clearly identify and manage asynchronous operations.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Standard Library Integration</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">As part of Python's standard library <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">since version 3.4</a>, AsyncIO is well-maintained and widely adopted. This integration ensures consistent updates and comprehensive documentation, providing a reliable foundation for asynchronous programming.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Performance Efficiency</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Benchmarks indicate that AsyncIO can outperform other asynchronous libraries. For instance, with the uvloop event loop, <a href="https://dev.to/skywind3000/performance-asyncio-vs-gevent-vs-native-epoll-bnl" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">AsyncIO has demonstrated performance reaching up to 88% of native epoll implementations</a>, showcasing its efficiency in handling asynchronous tasks.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Philosophical Similarities Between Eventlet and asyncio in Asynchronous Programming</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Both Eventlet and AsyncIO are designed to facilitate asynchronous programming in Python, aiming to improve application performance and responsiveness by managing concurrent operations efficiently. Despite differences in their implementation approaches, they share fundamental philosophical principles.​​</p>

    <h2 class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold">Advantages of Native Threads</h2>

    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">True Parallelism</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Native threads, managed by the operating system, enable true parallel execution on multi-core processors. This capability is particularly beneficial for CPU-bound tasks that require concurrent processing. This point is even particularly true now <a href="https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/" class="text-cyan-400" target="_blank">that the global interpreter lock is deactivable</a>.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Broad Compatibility</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Native threads operate seamlessly with most Python libraries without necessitating modifications. This compatibility ensures that existing codebases can leverage threading without extensive refactoring.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Automatic Scheduling</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">The operating system handles the scheduling of native threads, providing automatic context switching and load balancing. This management simplifies the development process by abstracting the complexities of manual task scheduling.​</p>
    <h3 class="mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Philosophical Similarities Between Green Threads and Native Threads</h3>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">Despite differences in their implementation and management, green threads and native threads share a common philosophical foundation in concurrent programming. Both paradigms aim to enhance the efficiency and responsiveness of applications by allowing multiple tasks to progress seemingly simultaneously.​​</p>

<section>
    <h2 class="mt-10 text-3xl font-bold">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="mt-10 text-xl">While Eventlet offers a means to achieve asynchronous programming through green threads and monkey patching, AsyncIO and native threads present robust alternatives. AsyncIO provides explicit and efficient asynchronous programming within Python's standard library, whereas native threads offer true parallelism and broad compatibility. The choice between these alternatives depends on the specific requirements of the project, such as the nature of the tasks (I/O-bound vs. CPU-bound) and the desired concurrency model.​</p>
