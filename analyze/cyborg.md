# Analysis for Team: cyborg Project: cyborg
---

- **Project:** Cyborg
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** No
    *Reason: The presence of `eventlet.monkey_patch()` in the codebase suggests that Eventlet is tightly integrated into the project's functionality and cannot be easily deactivated or replaced.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 9
    *This level represents a highly complex migration requiring extensive changes across the entire codebase.*
    *Factors for estimation: Widespread use of green threads, deferred tasks, and Eventlet-specific features (e.g., `eventlet.monkey_patch()`, `executor='eventlet'`), which would necessitate thorough refactoring and testing to ensure system stability.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `cmd/__init__.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          *Description:* The file imports Eventlet's WSGI server, indicating a direct dependency on its functionality.
    - **File:** `common/rpc.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          *Description:* The file contains configurations related to `eventlet.wsgi`, further solidifying the project's reliance on Eventlet.
    - **File:** `tests/base.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet` in Tests
          *Description:* This test file employs `eventlet.Timeout()` to manage a timeout, demonstrating the use of Eventlet's features in unit tests.
    - **File:** `tests/unit/__init__.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet` in Tests
          *Description:* The file uses `eventlet.monkey_patch(os=False)` to enable or disable certain functionality, highlighting Eventlet's use in testing scenarios.
    - **File:** `requirements.txt`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Dependencies
          *Description:* Eventlet is listed as a dependency (>=0.26.0 # MIT), indicating that it is an essential component of the project's infrastructure.
  - **Overall Conclusion:**
    - **Summary of Key Points:** Cyborg extensively relies on Eventlet, both functionally and programmatically. Removing or replacing Eventlet would necessitate substantial modifications to its underlying architecture.*
    - **Potential Challenges:** Migrating away from Eventlet could introduce significant complexity due to the project's deep integration with its features.
    - **Recommendations:** Carefully evaluate alternative asynchronous libraries (e.g., asyncio), develop a comprehensive plan for incremental refactoring, and ensure thorough testing at each stage to maintain system stability.
