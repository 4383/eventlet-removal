# Analysis for Team: zaqar

## Project: python-zaqarclient
---

- **Project:** python-zaqarclient
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Yes
    *The presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 4
    *This level represents a simple migration requiring minimal code changes.*
    *Factors for estimation: The use of Eventlet is limited to specific features and does not appear to be deeply integrated into the project's core functionality.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/zaqarclient.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          - **Description:** The file contains an import statement for Eventlet, indicating a dependency on its WSGI server.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/zaqarclient_api.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          - **Description:** This file uses the `eventlet.wsgi` module, which is a part of Eventlet's WSGI server.
    - **File:** `tests/test_zaqarclient.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          - **Description:** This test file uses `mock.patch('eventlet.spawn')` to mock Eventlet's spawn function, indicating that Eventlet is used in unit tests.
  - **Overall Conclusion:**
    - **Summary of Key Points:** Eventlet is used primarily for its WSGI server and in unit tests, with minimal impact on the project's core functionality.
    - **Potential Challenges:** Removing Eventlet would likely require minimal code changes, but ensuring that alternative asynchronous libraries are properly integrated could introduce some complexity.
    - **Recommendations:** Perform a thorough review of the project's dependencies to ensure that alternative libraries can replace Eventlet without issues.
