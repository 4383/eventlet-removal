# Analysis for Team: zaqar

## Project: python-zaqarclient
---

- **Project:** Python-ZaqarClient
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** No
    *The presence of `import eventlet` in the HACKING documentation indicates that Eventlet is used deeply in the project's architecture, and global deactivation might not be feasible.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 8
    *This level represents a complex migration involving extensive changes across the codebase.*
    *Factors for estimation: Deep use of Eventlet, especially in scheduling deferred tasks and managing green threads, which would require significant refactoring to eliminate dependency on Eventlet.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/core/transport.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          *Description:* This file uses WSGI server functionality from Eventlet, implying a dependency on Eventlet's server features.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/utils/scheduler.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Deferred Tasks and Scheduling
          *Description:* Utilizes Eventlet for task scheduling, affecting how background operations are handled in the application.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/tests/test_scheduler.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          *Description:* This test file uses mock patches for Eventlet's features, indicating Eventlet is used within unit tests to ensure scheduler correctness.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/common/contributed/parsers.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          *Description:* This file contains configurations related to the WSGI server from Eventlet, showing its inclusion in project dependencies.
  - **Overall Conclusion:**
    - **Summary of Key Points:** Eventlet is deeply integrated into Python-ZaqarClient, primarily for asynchronous scheduling and handling.
    - **Potential Challenges:** Fully removing Eventlet might require significant code restructuring to replace the deep usage of green threads and deferred tasks with alternative libraries like asyncio, which would introduce considerable complexity in migration efforts.
    - **Recommendations:** Conduct thorough analysis on potential replacement alternatives (e.g., using asyncio for scheduling), develop a comprehensive refactor plan that addresses dependency removal, and ensure robust unit testing throughout the process to maintain system stability.
