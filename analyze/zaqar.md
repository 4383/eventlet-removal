# Analysis for Team: zaqar Project: python-zaqarclient
---

- **Project:** python-zaqarclient
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Yes
    *The presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 6
    *This level represents a moderate to relatively simple migration.* 
    *Factors for estimation: The extensive use of green threads and deferred tasks, which would require some code refactoring to eliminate the dependency on Eventlet. Additionally, the direct references in `HACKING.rst` are clear indicators that the project might be adaptable or even designed with global deactivation in mind.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/zaqarclient/app.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          - **Description:** This file contains an argument that allows for global deactivation, which enables a setting for Eventlet's WSGI server.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/zaqarclient/handler.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Deferred Tasks and Scheduling
          - **Description:** The file uses Eventlet to schedule deferred tasks, impacting how background operations are handled.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/tests/test_handler.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          - **Description:** This test file uses `mock.patch('eventlet.spawn')` to mock Eventlet's spawn function, indicating that Eventlet is used in unit tests.
    - **File:** `zaqarclient/zaqarclient/app.py (continuation)`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          - **Description:** The file includes a setting related to eventlet.wsgi, showing that Eventlet is integrated within the project's dependencies.

- **Overall Conclusion:**
  - **Summary of Key Points:** Python-ZaqarClient uses Eventlet extensively for managing asynchronous operations, scheduling deferred tasks, and handling background operations.
  - **Potential Challenges:** Migrating away from Eventlet would require adapting the use of green threads, scheduling mechanisms, and configuration management. Care should be taken to ensure that any changes are thoroughly tested at each stage to maintain system stability.
  - **Recommendations:**
    *Carefully evaluate alternative asynchronous libraries (e.g., asyncio),*
    *plan for incremental refactoring, and ensure thorough testing at each stage.*
    *Consider the benefits of Eventlet's global deactivability in favor of more flexible project design.*
