# Analysis for Team: storlets Project: storlets
- **Project:** OpenStack Storlets
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Maybe
    *Reason for doubt: While some critical functionalities deeply use Eventlet, the presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 8
    *This level represents a complex migration involving extensive changes across the codebase.*
    *Factors for estimation: Extensive use of green threads and deferred tasks, which would require significant code refactoring to eliminate the dependency on Eventlet. Additionally, the project's architecture is quite modular, making it harder to predict where changes might have unintended consequences.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `storlets/gateway/common/exceptions.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          - **Description:** The file contains a use of `from eventlet import Timeout`, which indicates that Eventlet is used for unit testing purposes.
    - **File:** `storlets/gateway/gateways/container/runtime.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Green Threads and GreenPool
          - **Description:** This file uses `eventlet.spawn` to manage green threads, which is essential for the asynchronous operation of the gateway.
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          - **Description:** The file imports `eventlet`, indicating a dependency on Eventlet's WSGI server.
    - **File:** `storlets/swift_middleware/storlet_handler.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          - **Description:** This file uses the `eventlet.wsgi` server, which is a key component of Eventlet's WSGI integration.
    - **File:** `storlets/tests/unit/gateway/gateways/container/test_gateway.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Deferred Tasks and Scheduling
          - **Description:** The file uses `eventlet.sleep(0.1)` to introduce a delay, indicating the use of deferred tasks.
  - **Overall Conclusion:**
    - **Summary of Key Points:** Eventlet is used extensively across the project, particularly for managing asynchronous operations using green threads and in configuration files.
    - **Potential Challenges:** Removing Eventlet would require replacing core asynchronous mechanisms and adjusting configuration management, which could introduce significant complexity. Additionally, the use of `eventlet.wsgi` might need to be replaced with an alternative WSGI server if Eventlet is deactivated.
    - **Recommendations:** Carefully evaluate alternative asynchronous libraries (e.g., asyncio), plan for incremental refactoring, and ensure thorough testing at each stage to maintain system stability.
