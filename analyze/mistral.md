# Analysis for Team: mistral

## Project: mistral
The `eventlet` library is being used in various places throughout the OpenStack Mistral project. Here's a summary of where `eventlet` is being used:

1. **Scheduler tests**: In several test files (`test_default_scheduler.py`, `test_legacy_scheduler.py`, etc.), `eventlet` is imported and used to simulate delays with `eventlet.sleep()`.
2. **Service tests**: In `test_trigger_service.py`, `eventlet` is imported and used to introduce delays with `eventlet.sleep()` in various places.
3. **Launcher tests**: In `test_launcher.py`, `eventlet` is imported and used to spawn tasks with `eventlet.spawn(launch.launch_any, ...)`.
4. **Releasenotes**: The `eventlet` library is mentioned as a recommended executor for the Oslo RPC system in the releasenotes file.
5. **Requirements and setup**: In the `requirements.txt` file, `eventlet>=0.26.0` is listed as a dependency. In the `setup.cfg` file, `eventlet = futurist:GreenThreadPoolExecutor` is used to configure the eventlet executor.

Overall, it appears that `eventlet` is being used to introduce delays and simulate concurrent execution in various tests and configurations throughout the Mistral project.
