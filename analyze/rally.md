# Analysis for Team: rally

## Project: performance-docs
**Project:** OpenStack Watcher
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Maybe
    *Reason for doubt: While some critical functionalities deeply use Eventlet, the presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 7
    *This level represents a moderate migration requiring significant code refactoring.*
    *Factors for estimation: Extensive use of green threads and deferred tasks, which would require significant code refactoring to eliminate the dependency on Eventlet.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `watcher/applier/workflow_engine/base.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Green Threads and GreenPool
          - **Description:** This file uses `eventlet.spawn` to manage green threads, which is essential for the asynchronous operation of the workflow engine.
    - **File:** `watcher/common/service.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          - **Description:** The file contains configurations related to `eventlet.wsgi`, indicating a dependency on Eventlet's WSGI server.
    - **File:** `watcher/tests/applier/workflow_engine/test_taskflow_action_container.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          - **Description:** This test file uses `mock.patch('eventlet.spawn')` to mock Eventlet's spawn function, indicating that Eventlet is used in unit tests.
    - **File:** `watcher/common/utils.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Deferred Tasks and Scheduling
          - **Description:** Uses Eventlet's features to schedule deferred tasks, impacting how background operations are handled.

  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Maybe
    *Reason for doubt: While some critical functionalities deeply use Eventlet, the presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 7
    *This level represents a moderate migration requiring significant code refactoring.*
    *Factors for estimation: Extensive use of green threads and deferred tasks, which would require significant code refactoring to eliminate the dependency on Eventlet.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `watcher/applier/workflow_engine/base.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Green Threads and GreenPool
          - **Description:** This file uses `eventlet.spawn` to manage green threads, which is essential for the asynchronous operation of the workflow engine.
    - **File:** `watcher/common/service.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          - **Description:** The file contains configurations related to `eventlet.wsgi`, indicating a dependency on Eventlet's WSGI server.

      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`
          - **Description:** This test file uses `mock.patch('eventlet.spawn')` to mock Eventlet's spawn function, indicating that Eventlet is used in unit tests.
    - **File:** `watcher/common/utils.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Deferred Tasks and Scheduling
          - **Description:** Uses Eventlet's features to schedule deferred tasks, impacting how background operations are handled.

- **Project:** Rally
  - **Is Eventlet globally deactivable for this project:** Maybe
    *Reason for doubt: While some critical functionalities deeply use Eventlet, the presence of an Eventlet-specific argparse option suggests that it might be deactivable.*
  - **Estimated complexity of the migration:** 8
    *This level represents a complex migration involving extensive changes across the codebase.*
    *Factors for estimation: Extensive use of green threads and deferred tasks, which would require significant code refactoring to eliminate the dependency on Eventlet. Additionally, the presence of Eventlet's monkey patching in multiple files indicates that it is deeply integrated into the project.*
  - **Files Analyzed:**
    - **File:** `rally/utils/sshutils.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Presence in Configuration Files and Dependencies
          *Description:* The file contains configurations related to `eventlet.wsgi`, indicating a dependency on Eventlet's WSGI server.
        - **Pattern:** Use of `eventlet.wsgi`
          *Description:* The file uses `eventlet.wsgi` for handling WSGI requests, which is essential for the project's functionality.
    - **File:** `rally/tests/applier/workflow_engine/test_taskflow_action_container.py`
      - **Identified Patterns:**
        - **Pattern:** Use in Tests with `mock`

          *Description:* Uses Eventlet's features to schedule deferred tasks, impacting how background operations are handled.
  - **Overall Conclusion:**
    - **Summary of Key Points:** Eventlet is deeply integrated into the project, particularly for handling WSGI requests and scheduling deferred tasks. Its presence in configuration files and test code indicates a strong dependency on its functionality.
    - **Potential Challenges:** Removing Eventlet would require replacing core asynchronous mechanisms and adjusting configuration management, which could introduce significant complexity. Additionally, the use of Eventlet's monkey patching across multiple files suggests that it is deeply embedded in the project's architecture.
    - **Recommendations:** Carefully evaluate alternative asynchronous libraries (e.g., asyncio), plan for incremental refactoring, and ensure thorough testing at each stage to maintain system stability.
